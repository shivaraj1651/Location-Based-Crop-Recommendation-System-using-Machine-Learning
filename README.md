# Location-Based-Crop-Recommendation-System-using-Machine-Learning
Location-Based Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning. A Flask web app that predicts the best crop based on soil type, temperature, humidity, and rainfall. Built using Python, HTML, Pandas, and Scikit-learn with SVM and Random Forest, where Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy for recommendations.
Technologies Used

Python

Flask (Backend)

HTML / CSS (Frontend)

Scikit-learn

Pandas, NumPy
Machine Learning Models

This system implements and compares two ML algorithms:

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Random Forest Classifier

After evaluation, the Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy and is used for final crop predictions in the application.

Features

User-friendly HTML interface for environmental data input

Flask-based backend to process inputs and return predictions

Machine learning model integrated for intelligent decision-making

Recommends the best crop based on climate and soil data

Supports data-driven and sustainable agriculture practices
